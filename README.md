Pick a random movie on any LetterBoxd page. Press R to roll a movie, and Shift+R to exit the roulette. Works for watchlist, any user list, and anywhere you can find a gallery of film posters on the site. Turn on the "Fade watched films" switch (the one already on the vanilla LetterBoxd site) to make the roulette skip watched films.
